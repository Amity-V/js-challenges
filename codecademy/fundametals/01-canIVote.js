// The most common minimum age to vote is 18. Write a function canIVote()
// that takes in a number, representing a personâ€™s age, and returns the
// boolean true if they are 18 years old or older, and the boolean false
// if they are not.

// Write your function here:

const canIVote = (age) => age >= 18;

// Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
console.log(canIVote(19)) // Should print true
