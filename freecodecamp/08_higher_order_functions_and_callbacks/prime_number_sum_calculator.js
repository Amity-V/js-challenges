// In this lab, you will build a calculator that takes a number and returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to that number.

// Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

// User Stories:

// 1. You should have a sumPrimes function that accepts a number as an argument.
// 2. The sumPrimes function should return the sum of all prime numbers less than or equal to the provided number.
// 3. If the input number is less than 2, the function should return 0.



// Tests

// 1. You should have a sumPrimes function.
// 2. sumPrimes(10) should return 17.
// 3. sumPrimes(5) should return 10.
// 4. sumPrimes(2) should return 2.
// 5. sumPrimes(0) should return 0.
// 6. sumPrimes(977) should return 73156.
