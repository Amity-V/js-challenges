// In this lab, you will create a function that takes an array of two numbers and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of those two numbers and all the numbers between them.

// Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

// User Stories

// 1. You should have a smallestCommons function that accepts an array of two numbers as an argument.
// 2. The smallestCommons function should return the smallest common multiple that is evenly divisible by both numbers and all sequential numbers in the range between them.
// 3. The function should handle input where the two numbers are not in numerical order.



// Tests

// 1. You should have a smallestCommons function.
// 2. smallestCommons([1, 5]) should return a number.
// 3. smallestCommons([1, 5]) should return 60.
// 4. smallestCommons([5, 1]) should return 60.
// 5. smallestCommons([2, 10]) should return 2520.
// 6. smallestCommons([1, 13]) should return 360360.
// 7. smallestCommons([23, 18]) should return 6056820.
