// In this lab you will build an odd Fibonacci sum calculator that computes the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to a given positive integer.

// Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

// User Stories

// 1. You should have a sumFibs function that accepts a number as an argument.
// 2. The sumFibs function should return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to the given number.
// 3. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous ones.
// 4. Only the odd Fibonacci numbers should be added to the sum.



// Tests

// 1. You should have a sumFibs function.
// 2. sumFibs(1) should return a number.
// 3. sumFibs(1000) should return 1785.
// 4. sumFibs(4000000) should return 4613732.
// 5. sumFibs(4) should return 5.
// 6. sumFibs(75024) should return 60696.
// 7. sumFibs(75025) should return 135721.
