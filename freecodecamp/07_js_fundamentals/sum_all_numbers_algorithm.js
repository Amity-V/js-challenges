// In this lab, you will need to design a sum all numbers algorithm.

// Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

// User Stories:

// 1. You should have a function named sumAll that accepts an array of two numbers.
// 2. sumAll([n, m]) should return the sum of n and m plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first. For example, sumAll([4,1]) should return 10 because sum of all the numbers between 1 and 4 (both inclusive) is 10.



// 1. You should have a function named sumAll.
// 2. sumAll([1, 4]) should return a number.
// 3. sumAll([1, 4]) should return 10.
// 4. sumAll([4, 1]) should return 10.
// 5. sumAll([5, 10]) should return 45.
// 6. sumAll([10, 5]) should return 45.
