// In this lab, you will define five fortunes and randomly select one of them to display the fortune to the user.

// Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

// User Stories:

// You should initialize the five variables fortune1, fortune2, fortune3, fortune4, and fortune5 with a string value of your choice. You can use the below options if you like:
// - "Your cat will look very cuddly today."
// - "The weather will be nice tomorrow."
// - "Be cautious of your new neighbors."
// - "You will find a new hobby soon."
// - "It would be wise to avoid the color red today."
// You should select a random number between 1 and 5, inclusive, and assign it to the variable randomNumber.
// You should create a selectedFortune variable and assign the appropriate fortune based on these rules:
// - If randomNumber is 1, assign the value of fortune1 to selectedFortune.
// - If randomNumber is 2, assign the value of fortune2 to selectedFortune.
// - If randomNumber is 3, assign the value of fortune3 to selectedFortune.
// - If randomNumber is 4, assign the value of fortune4 to selectedFortune.
// - If randomNumber is 5, assign the value of fortune5 to selectedFortune.
// You should log the selectedFortune to the console.

const fortune1 = "Your cat will look very cuddly today.";
const fortune2 = "The weather will be nice tomorrow.";
const fortune3 = "Be cautious of your new neighbors.";
const fortune4 = "You will find a new hobby soon.";
const fortune5 = "It would be wise to avoid the color red today.";

const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;

let selectedFortune;

if (randomNumber === 1) {
    selectedFortune = fortune1;
} else if (randomNumber === 2) {
    selectedFortune = fortune2;
} else if (randomNumber === 3) {
    selectedFortune = fortune3;
} else if (randomNumber === 4) {
    selectedFortune = fortune4;
} else if (randomNumber === 5) {
    selectedFortune = fortune5;
}

console.log(selectedFortune);

// Tests

// 1. You should initialize fortune1 with a string value.
// 2. You should initialize fortune2 with a string value.
// 3. You should initialize fortune3 with a string value.
// 4. You should initialize fortune4 with a string value.
// 5. You should initialize fortune5 with a string value.
// 6. You should use the Math.random() method to generate a random number.
// 7. You should generate a random number between 1 and 5, inclusive, and assign it to the variable randomNumber.
// 8. You should have a selectedFortune variable that is assigned a value based on the value of randomNumber.
// 9. The randomNumber should correspond to its fortune. For example, if randomNumber is 1, the selectedFortune should be equal to fortune1 and so on.
// 10. You should output the selectedFortune to the console.
