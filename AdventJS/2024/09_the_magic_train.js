// The elves are playing with a magical train 🚂 that carries gifts. This train moves on a board represented by an array of strings.

// The train consists of an engine (@), followed by its carriages (o), and must collect magical fruits (*) which serve as fuel. The movement of the train follows these rules:

// You will receive two parameters board and mov.

// board is an array of strings that represents the board:
// - @ is the train's engine.
// - o are the train's carriages.
// - * is a magical fruit.
// - · are empty spaces.

// mov is a string that indicates the next movement of the train from the train's head @:
// - 'L': left
// - 'R': right
// - 'U': up
// - 'D': down.

// With this information, you must return a string:
// - 'crash': If the train crashes into the edges of the board or itself.
// - 'eat': If the train collects a magical fruit (*).
// - 'none': If it moves without crashing or collecting any magical fruit.

// Example:

// const board = [
//   '·····',
//   '*····',
//   '@····',
//   'o····',
//   'o····'
// ]

// console.log(moveTrain(board, 'U'))
// // ➞ 'eat'
// // Because the train moves up and finds a magical fruit

// console.log(moveTrain(board, 'D'))
// // ➞ 'crash'
// // The train moves down and the head crashes into itself

// console.log(moveTrain(board, 'L'))
// // ➞ 'crash'
// // The train moves to the left and crashes into the wall

// console.log(moveTrain(board, 'R'))
// // ➞ 'none'
// // The train moves to the right and there is empty space on the right

/**
 * @param {string[]} board - Represent the train situation
 * @param {'U' | 'D' | 'R' | 'L' } mov - Movement direction
 * @returns {'none' | 'crash' | 'eat'}
 */

function moveTrain(board, mov) {
  // Code here
  return "none";
}
